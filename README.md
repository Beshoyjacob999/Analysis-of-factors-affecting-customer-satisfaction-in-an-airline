# Analysis-of-factors-affecting-customer-satisfaction-in-an-airline
Please note that customer satisfaction is one of the most important improved-level criteria for airlines. For the customer, quality is defined by whether they are satisfied or not with their overall experience. And with the high competition between airlines, there is a strong need for a model that is powerful enough to understand what makes a customer satisfied or unsatisfied. Also, by using clustering, we can go from bottom to top to identify the factors that affect customer satisfaction. For example, these could be: type of flight, travel class, reducing waiting during interrogation process, method, etc. So, we can discover the strengths and weaknesses in the customer experience and this helps us know how to improve it. The final goal is to improve quality, reduce the number of complaints, and increase customer loyalty.
